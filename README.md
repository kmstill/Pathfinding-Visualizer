This project was built using React using state hooks and functional components. 

The following screenshot shows the view before an algorithm has been visualized:

The green node in the grid is the start node and the red node is the end node. To move either the 
start or end node, click the current start/end node to make it disappear and click another node
to make the start/end node appear there. 
The black nodes are wall nodes that cannot be traversed by the pathfinding algorithm. Create
wall nodes by clicking and dragging across the grid. Walls can also be randomly generated by clicking
the "Randomize Walls" button. 

To visaulize an algorithm, click the button for that algorithm. The view after visualizing  an
algorithm is shown in the next screenshot:

The blue nodes are nodes that were visited by the search algorithm. The pink nodes are nodes that lie on the 
shortest path between the start and end nodes. 

To clear the path that was visualized but keep the wall layout, click the "Clear Path Only" button. To completley clear
the grid, click the "clear Walls and Path" button.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
